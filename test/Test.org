Until I figure out how to build automatic tests I need to build a manual test plan.

Things to test:
1. task command
2. global tasks
3. etask command


* Task command

- execute :: SP z task
- result :: listing of test folder


* Global tasks


** Prequisite

- execute :: SP z init

** clean

- execute :: SP z info
- result ::


* etask command
